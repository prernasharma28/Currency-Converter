**Currency Converter Web Application**

**📜 Overview**

This web application allows users to convert currencies using an intuitive interface. The application consists of a Java backend to handle currency conversion logic and a frontend to display and interact with the conversion results.

**📁 Project Files**

Currency.java: Java file that contains the logic for currency conversion. It interacts with external APIs or databases to fetch current currency exchange rates.
index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web application.
script.js: JavaScript file that manages the client-side logic, including interactions with the backend and updates to the user interface.
styles.css: CSS file that styles the web application to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design.

**🌟 Features**

Currency Conversion: Users can convert between different currencies.
Real-Time Updates: The application fetches and displays the latest currency exchange rates.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**🛠️ Setup**

**Prerequisites**
A Java Development Kit (JDK) for running Currency.java.
A modern web browser for viewing index.html.
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Getting Started

**Run the Java Code:**

Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
Compile Currency.java and run it to start the backend service. This will handle currency conversion requests from the frontend.

**Open the Web Page:**

Open index.html in a web browser to view the frontend of the application.

**Link Frontend and Backend:**

Ensure script.js is correctly configured to make requests to the Java backend. Update any endpoint URLs if necessary.

**⚙️ Functionality**

**Currency Conversion:** Enter the amount and select currencies to convert. The result is displayed on the page. 💱
Styling: The look and feel of the application is managed through styles.css. 🎨
Client-Side Interaction: script.js handles user interactions, form submissions, and dynamic updates. 🖥️

**📝 Code Details**

Currency.java: Contains methods for fetching exchange rates and performing currency conversion.
index.html: Sets up the structure of the application, including form elements and display areas.
script.js: Manages client-side logic, including fetching data from the Java backend and updating the DOM.
styles.css: Provides styling to ensure a responsive and attractive user interface.

**🛠️ Troubleshooting**

Java Backend Issues: Ensure that Currency.java is running correctly and is accessible from the frontend.
UI Issues: Check the console for errors and ensure that script.js and styles.css are properly linked in index.html.
Conversion Accuracy: Verify that the currency conversion logic in Currency.java is correctly implemented and that the external APIs or data sources are up-to-date.
